# HCAHPS Patient Perspective of Care Survey
### Overview
The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey is the first national, standardized, publicly reported survey of patients' perspectives of their hospital experience. The survey is administered to a random sample of patients across medical conditions anywhere between 48 hours and 6 weeks after discharge. The survey consists of 29 questions:
  - 19 core questions about critical aspects of the patient's experience (communication with doctors, responsiveness of hospital staff, cleanliness and quietness of the hospital, etc).
  - 3 items that direct patients to relevant questions.
  - 5 items to adjust for the mix of patients across hospitals.
  - 2 items that support congressionally-mandated reports.

Data used in this study can be found at the [CMS Data Catalog](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search?theme=Hospitals)

### Context
Hospital patient satisfaction is a critical indicator of healthcare quality. Results of HCAHPS surveys impact hospital reimbursement through programs like the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program. Understanding and improving patient experience is vital for hospitals to enhance their quality of care, maintain reputation, and optimize financial performance. This project aims to leverage publicly available HCAHPS data to provide actionable insights for hospitals.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive analytical tool for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to patient experience for hospitals over a four-year span. This involves:
  - **Performance Tracking**: monitoring trends in patient satisfaction scores across various HCAHPS measures.
  - **Benchmarking**: comparing hospital performance against national, regional, and state averages to identify areas of excellence and potential pain points.
  - **Insight Generation**: uncovering specific areas for growth and improvement by pinpointing categories where a hospital significantly deviates from its peers or benchmarks.
