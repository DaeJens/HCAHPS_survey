# HCAHPS Patient Perspective of Care Survey
### Overview
The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey is the first national, standardized, publicly reported survey of patients' perspectives of their hospital experience. The survey is administered to a random sample of patients across medical conditions anywhere between 48 hours and 6 weeks after discharge. The survey consists of 29 questions:
  - 19 core questions about critical aspects of the patient's experience (communication with doctors, responsiveness of hospital staff, cleanliness and quietness of the hospital, etc).
  - 3 items that direct patients to relevant questions.
  - 5 items to adjust for the mix of patients across hospitals.
  - 2 items that support congressionally-mandated reports.

Data used in this study can be found at the [CMS Data Catalog](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search?theme=Hospitals)
